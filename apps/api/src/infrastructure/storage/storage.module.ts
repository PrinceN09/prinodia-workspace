/**
 * GovSphere — Storage Module
 *
 * Provides MinIO (S3-compatible) file storage.
 * All uploaded files go through this module — never stored in PostgreSQL.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - MinIO client initialization and health check
 *   - Bucket creation on startup (idempotent)
 *   - Pre-signed URL generation for secure file access
 *   - File metadata management (actual metadata stored in PostgreSQL `File` table)
 *
 * File Storage Rules (enforced at the service layer):
 *   1. Never store file content in PostgreSQL
 *   2. Never expose MinIO URLs directly — always proxy through the API
 *   3. All file access must be authenticated and permission-checked
 *   4. File operations must produce an AuditLog entry
 *
 * TODO Sprint 3: Implement StorageService with upload, download, delete, presign.
 *
 * @see docs/04_Database_Architecture.md — File model
 * @see docs/07_Security_Architecture.md — File security

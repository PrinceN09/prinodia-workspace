## How to Use This Documentation

**New to GovSphere?** Start with [01 — Product Vision](./01_Product_Vision.md) and [03 — System Architecture](./03_System_Architecture.md).

**Setting up locally?** See the [README](../README.md#local-development) at the repository root.

**Working on auth or security?** Read [07 — Security Architecture](./07_Security_Architecture.md) and [11 — Identity Platform](./11_Identity_Platform_Architecture.md) first.

**Adding a new feature?** Check [08 — Engineering Standards](./08_Engineering_Standards.md) for code conventions and [05 — API Architecture](./05_API_Architecture.md) for endpoint design patterns.

**Making a major technology decision?** Create an ADR in `docs/adr/`. Use the [ADR-001 template](./adr/ADR-001-postgresql.md) as a reference.

## Document Conventions

- All headings use sentence case (not Title Case for body headings)
- Code samples use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Tables are used for structured comparisons and reference data
- Status badges: ✅ Complete, 🔜 In Progress, 📋 Planned, ❌ Deprecated

## Keeping Documentation Current

Documentation is updated alongside code. If a PR changes behavior described in a document, the document must be updated in the same PR. Stale documentation is treated as a bug.

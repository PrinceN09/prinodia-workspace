## 1. Identity Platform Purpose

### Why Identity Is the Foundation

GovSphere is a platform where ministers discuss national policy, department heads share classified circulars, and civil servants collaborate on sensitive government operations. Every feature — messaging, file sharing, channels, meetings — depends on one absolute prerequisite: **we must know who you are, and we must be certain**.

If the identity platform fails, the entire security model collapses. A message in the wrong person's hands is a data breach. A file downloaded by an unauthorized user is a national security event. A shared account used by two civil servants makes audit trails meaningless and accountability impossible.

The Identity Platform is therefore not just a login screen. It is the enforcement point for:

- **Authentication** — prove who you are
- **Authorization** — determine what you are allowed to do
- **Accountability** — record every action you take
- **Session integrity** — ensure your credential is valid for the duration of every request

No feature in GovSphere is built until the Identity Platform is in place and hardened. This is a deliberate engineering decision: all other modules — Channels, Messages, Files, Search — are built on top of the identity layer and delegate every access decision to it.

### Design Principles for the Identity Platform

- **No implicit trust.** Every request is authenticated. Expired or missing tokens are always rejected, regardless of the source.
- **Least privilege by default.** A new user has zero permissions until explicitly granted a role. Roles grant only what is necessary.
- **Explicit scope.** A Ministry Admin's power extends only to their ministry. A Division Admin's power extends only to their division. Scope violations are blocked at the API layer, not just the UI.
- **Auditability.** Every identity event — login, logout, role change, password reset — is permanently recorded and cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Graceful degradation.** If the identity platform has a temporary error, the rest of the platform fails safely: access is denied, not granted.

## 2. Authentication Methods

### 2.1 Supported Methods (Current)

#### Method 1: Matricule Number + Password

The Matricule Number is the government-issued civil servant identification number for the DRC. It is the primary and preferred authentication method for all government employees.

**Format rules:**
- Stored as a `String` in the database — never as `Int` or `BigInt`
- Leading zeros must be preserved
- Dots (`.`) are part of the format and must be stored as-is
- No normalization on input — the user types it exactly as it appears on their government ID card

**Accepted matricule formats:**

| Example | Notes |
|---|---|
| `1.641.558` | Three-part format, most common |
| `478.432` | Two-part format |
| `424.55` | Two-part format, shorter second segment |

**Validation regex:** `^\d{1,4}(\.\d{1,4}){1,2}$`

**Lookup rule:** API performs an exact string match against `User.matricule`. Case does not apply (digits and dots only). Whitespace is trimmed before comparison.

#### Method 2: Government Email + Password

All civil servants are issued a `@gouv.cd` email address. This is the secondary authentication method.

**Format:** `[firstname.lastname]@[ministry].gouv.cd`  
**Example:** `jean.mbeki@finances.gouv.cd`

**Validation:** Standard email format validation. The email domain must end in `.gouv.cd`. External email domains (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) are rejected for this authentication path.

**Lookup rule:** API performs a case-insensitive match against `User.email`.

### 2.2 Future Methods (Not Yet Implemented)

#### Method 3: Microsoft SSO (v1.5+)

For civil servants whose ministries use Microsoft 365. Azure AD integration via OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect.

- **Scope:** Government employees only — must match an existing `User` record by email
- **Trigger:** "Sign in with Microsoft" button on the login screen
- **Account linking:** On first Microsoft SSO login, the system links the Microsoft account to the existing government user record (matched by `.gouv.cd` email)
- **Restriction:** Cannot be used to create new accounts — only to authenticate existing ones

#### Method 4: Google Sign-In for External Partners (v1.0+)

For invited external partners (NGO representatives, international partners, consultants) who do not have DRC government credentials.

- **Scope:** External partners with GUEST role ONLY
- **Trigger:** Invitation email containing a one-time acceptance link
- **Admin approval required:** A Ministry Admin or higher must issue the invitation
- **Domain restriction:** Any Google-managed email domain is accepted, but the invitation is bound to the specific email address — changing Google accounts after acceptance is not permitted without admin action
- **Cannot escalate:** External users authenticated via Google can never be promoted above GUEST role

### 2.3 Credential Storage Rules

| Credential | Storage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Password | bcrypt hash, cost factor 12 | Plaintext never stored |
| Matricule | Plaintext string | Not sensitive — government-issued public ID |
| Government email | Plaintext string | Normalized to lowercase on save |
| MFA secret | AES-256-GCM encrypted | Key in environment variable only |
| OAuth tokens | Not stored | OAuth flow is stateless — only the user identity is persisted |

---

## 3. User Types

User types describe the **role** a person plays in the government hierarchy. They are not the same as system roles (which control permissions) — they describe the person's real-world title and responsibilities.

| User Type | Description | Default System Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Government Employee** | Standard civil servant. The most common user type. Works in a specific ministry, department, and division. | `EMPLOYEE` |
| **Minister** | Head of a ministry. Participates in cross-ministry channels and has visibility into their ministry's full communication. | `MINISTRY_ADMIN` |
| **Director** | Head of a department within a ministry. Manages department-level channels and team assignments. | `DEPARTMENT_ADMIN` |
| **Department Admin** | IT or administrative manager responsible for onboarding and managing users within a department. Not a director — a technical administrator. | `DEPARTMENT_ADMIN` |
| **IT Administrator** | System-level administrator. Manages platform configuration, user accounts, and technical infrastructure. Not necessarily in any ministry. | `GOVERNMENT_ADMIN` |
| **External Partner** | Non-government collaborator (NGO, international organization, consultant). Invited by admin. Read-only access to explicitly shared channels. | `GUEST` |
| **Guest** | A temporary user — could be a visiting official or a contractor. Same permissions as External Partner. | `GUEST` |

**Important:** User type is a metadata field (`userType` on the `User` model) that describes the person. System role (stored in the `UserRole` join table) controls what they can actually do. A Minister must still be explicitly assigned `MINISTRY_ADMIN` — the user type alone does not grant permissions.

## 4. User Statuses

A user's status determines whether they can log in and use the platform at any given moment.

| Status | Can Log In | Can Use App | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | ❌ | ❌ | Account created by admin, but user has not completed first login / email verification. |
| `ACTIVE` | ✅ | ✅ | Normal operating state. Account is fully functional. |
| `SUSPENDED` | ❌ | ❌ | Temporarily disabled by admin. Common during investigations or disciplinary proceedings. The account and its data are preserved. |
| `LOCKED` | ❌ | ❌ | Automatically set after exceeding failed login attempts. Resets after lockout duration or admin action. |
| `DEACTIVATED` | ❌ | ❌ | Civil servant has left the ministry or changed positions. Account is disabled but data is retained for audit purposes. Set by admin. |
| `ARCHIVED` | ❌ | ❌ | Long-term storage state. Applied after a configurable retention period post-deactivation. User data is retained for legal compliance but the account is fully closed. |

### Status Transition Rules

```
Created by admin → PENDING
    PENDING + first login completed → ACTIVE
    ACTIVE + 5 failed logins → LOCKED
    LOCKED + lockout period expires → ACTIVE
    LOCKED + admin unlocks → ACTIVE
    ACTIVE + admin suspends → SUSPENDED
    SUSPENDED + admin reactivates → ACTIVE
    ACTIVE or SUSPENDED + admin deactivates → DEACTIVATED
    DEACTIVATED + retention period → ARCHIVED
```

**Transitions that are never permitted:**
- `ARCHIVED` → any other status (archived is permanent)
- Any status → `PENDING` (PENDING is only the initial state)

---

## 5. RBAC Model

### 5.1 Role Definitions

GovSphere uses a hierarchical role system. Higher role weight includes all permissions of lower roles in the same organizational scope, plus additional permissions.

| Role | Weight | Scope | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | 100 | System-wide | Full access to everything. Reserved for GovSphere platform engineers and the DRC IT authority. Maximum 3 accounts. |
| `GOVERNMENT_ADMIN` | 90 | Cross-ministry | Can manage all ministries. Assigned to IT administrators and senior government officials. |
| `MINISTRY_ADMIN` | 70 | Ministry | Full access within their assigned ministry. Can manage departments, divisions, users, and channels within the ministry. |
| `DEPARTMENT_ADMIN` | 50 | Department | Full access within their assigned department. Can manage divisions and users within the department. |
| `DIVISION_ADMIN` | 40 | Division | Full access within their assigned division. Can manage teams and users within the division. |
| `TEAM_MANAGER` | 30 | Team | Can manage their team's channels and members. |
| `EMPLOYEE` | 10 | Assigned channels | Standard user. Can send messages and upload files in channels they are members of. |
| `GUEST` | 0 | Invited channels | Read-only access to specific channels they have been invited to. Cannot send messages or upload files. |

### 5.2 Organizational Scope

Roles are scoped to organizational units. The scope is enforced at the data access layer — not just the UI — for every API request.

```
SUPER_ADMIN / GOVERNMENT_ADMIN
  └── [No scope restriction — cross-ministry access]

MINISTRY_ADMIN
  └── Ministry: { ministryId }
      └── Can access: all departments, divisions, teams, and channels within this ministry

DEPARTMENT_ADMIN
  └── Department: { departmentId }
      └── Can access: all divisions, teams, and channels within this department
      └── Exception: can also read ministry-level channels (read-only)

DIVISION_ADMIN
  └── Division: { divisionId }
      └── Can access: all teams and channels within this division

TEAM_MANAGER
  └── Team: { teamId }
      └── Can access: all channels within this team

EMPLOYEE
  └── Explicit channel membership only

GUEST
  └── Specific channel invitations only
```

### 5.3 Permission System

Permissions are fine-grained capabilities that can be grouped into roles. The system uses a `Role → RolePermission → Permission` join structure, allowing:

- Standard role assignments (role comes with a predefined permission set)
- Custom role creation (for ministries with unique workflows)
- Permission overrides (grant a specific permission to a user outside their role, for edge cases)

**Permission naming convention:** `RESOURCE:ACTION`

**Core permissions:**

```

### Channel-Level Access Control

Beyond role-level permissions, channel membership is a second independent gate. Even if a user has `CHANNEL:READ_MEMBER` permission, they can only read channels they are a member of. Being a MINISTRY_ADMIN grants the ability to join any channel in the ministry — but they are not automatically a member of every channel.

```
Access to a channel message requires BOTH:
  1. RBAC: User role has CHANNEL:READ_MEMBER AND channel is within user's scope
  2. Membership: User has an active ChannelMember record for that channel

Exception (overrides membership requirement):
  CHANNEL:MANAGE_ALL → can read any channel without being a member
  CHANNEL:MANAGE_MINISTRY → can read any channel within their ministry without being a member
```

## 7. Session Management

### 7.1 Token Architecture

GovSphere uses two-token authentication: a short-lived access token and a long-lived refresh token.

#### Access Token

```
Format:     JWT signed with RS256 (2048-bit RSA key pair)
TTL:        15 minutes
Storage:    Client memory only (JavaScript variable, React state)
            NEVER in localStorage, NEVER in sessionStorage

Payload:
{
  "sub":        "cuid-user-id",           // user ID
  "jti":        "cuid-token-id",          // unique token ID (for blacklisting)
  "role":       "MINISTRY_ADMIN",         // highest role name (for quick checks)
  "weight":     70,                       // role weight integer
  "ministryId": "cuid-ministry-id",       // organizational scope
  "sessionId":  "cuid-session-id",        // links token to session record
  "iat":        1719216600,               // issued at
  "exp":        1719217500                // expires at (iat + 15 min)
}
```

**Why RS256:** The private key signs tokens on the API server. Any service can verify tokens using the public key without needing the private key. The private key is never distributed.

**Why memory-only:** localStorage survives browser close and is readable by any JavaScript on the page (XSS vulnerability). Memory storage is cleared when the tab closes, limiting the exposure window.

#### Refresh Token

```
Format:     JWT signed with RS256 (same key pair)
TTL:        7 days
Storage:    HttpOnly cookie
            Secure: true (HTTPS only)
            SameSite: Strict (blocks cross-site requests)
            Path: /auth/refresh (only sent to the refresh endpoint)

Payload:
{
  "sub":       "cuid-user-id",
  "jti":       "cuid-token-id",
  "sessionId": "cuid-session-id",
  "family":    "cuid-token-family",       // for refresh token rotation family tracking
  "iat":       1719216600,
  "exp":       1719820800                 // 7 days
}
```

**Why HttpOnly:** The `HttpOnly` flag prevents JavaScript from reading the cookie. It can only be sent automatically by the browser to the server. This makes it XSS-immune.

**Why `Path: /auth/refresh`:** The refresh token cookie is only transmitted when the browser calls `/auth/refresh` — not on every API request. This limits the window where the cookie is in transit.

### 7.2 Token Rotation

On every call to `POST /auth/refresh`:

```
1. Validate the incoming refresh token (signature, expiry, not blacklisted)
2. Check that the sessionId in the token matches an active UserSession record
3. Issue a new access token (new jti, new exp)
4. Issue a new refresh token (new jti, same sessionId, new exp)
5. Blacklist the old refresh token jti in Redis (TTL = remaining time of old token)
6. Set the new refresh token as the HttpOnly cookie
7. Return the new access token in the response body
```

**Token family tracking:** Each refresh token carries a `family` identifier (set at login, not rotated). If a refresh token from a family is used after the family has been rotated (indicating token reuse / theft), the entire session is immediately invalidated and the user is forced to re-login.

### 7.3 Token Blacklist

The Redis blacklist is checked on every authenticated request:

```
Key:   blacklist:access:{jti}
Value: "1"
TTL:   Remaining seconds until token expiry

Key:   blacklist:refresh:{jti}
Value: "1"
TTL:   Remaining seconds until token expiry
```

Blacklisting events:
- `POST /auth/logout` → blacklist the current access token and refresh token
- `POST /auth/logout-all` → blacklist all active tokens for all sessions belonging to the user
- Admin suspends/deactivates account → blacklist all tokens for the user
- Password changed → blacklist all tokens for the user (force re-login on all devices)

### 7.4 Session Lifecycle

```
Login
  → Create UserSession record:
      { userId, deviceId, ipAddress, userAgent, platform, createdAt, lastUsedAt, isActive: true }
  → Both access and refresh tokens carry sessionId

Each API request
  → Validate access token
  → Verify sessionId in token matches an active UserSession
  → Update session.lastUsedAt

Refresh
  → Validate refresh token
  → Verify session is still active
  → Issue new tokens (rotation)

Logout
  → Set UserSession.isActive = false
  → Set UserSession.revokedAt = now()
  → Blacklist current access + refresh tokens
  → Clear HttpOnly cookie

Auto-expiry
  → Sessions with lastUsedAt older than 30 days are marked expired by a scheduled job
```

### 7.5 Multi-Device Support

Users can be logged in on multiple devices simultaneously:
- Web browser (Next.js)
- Desktop app (Tauri)
- Mobile app (React Native)

Each login creates an independent `UserSession`. Logging out from one device does not affect others unless `POST /auth/logout-all` is called.

## 8. MFA Design

### 8.1 TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) — Primary Method

```
Standard:   RFC 6238
Algorithm:  HMAC-SHA1
Period:     30 seconds
Digits:     6
Tolerance:  ±1 period (accepts codes from current and adjacent windows for clock skew)
Library:    otplib (Node.js)
QR format:  otpauth://totp/GovSphere:{email}?secret={base32secret}&issuer=GovSphere
```

**Compatible apps:** Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, Aegis (Android)

**MFA Setup Flow:**

```
1. User navigates to Account → Security → Enable MFA
2. POST /auth/mfa/setup (authenticated)
3. API generates a 160-bit cryptographically random secret (crypto.randomBytes(20))
4. API encodes secret as Base32
5. API generates otpauth:// URI and derives a QR code data URL
6. API returns: { secret: string (base32), qrCode: string (data URL), otpauthUri: string }
7. The MFA secret is NOT saved yet — user must verify before it is activated
8. User scans QR code, gets first code from authenticator app
9. POST /auth/mfa/verify-setup { code: "123456" }
10. API verifies the code against the unconfirmed secret
11. On success:
    a. Encrypt the secret with AES-256-GCM (key from MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY env)
    b. Save encrypted secret to User.mfaSecret
    c. Set User.mfaEnabled = true
    d. Generate 8 backup codes (see below)
    e. Return backup codes ONCE — this is the only time they are shown
12. Write AUDIT LOG: MFA_ENABLED
```

**MFA Login Flow:**

```
1. User completes credential check (matricule/email + password) — credentials valid
2. If User.mfaEnabled = true:
   a. Issue short-lived MFA challenge token (TTL: 5 minutes)
      { sub: userId, type: "mfa_challenge", exp: +5min }
   b. Return HTTP 202 with { mfaRequired: true, challengeToken: string }
   c. Client shows MFA code input screen
3. User submits code: POST /auth/mfa/verify { challengeToken, code }
4. API validates challenge token (not expired, type matches)
5. API fetches User, decrypts mfaSecret, verifies TOTP code
6. On success: Issue normal access + refresh tokens, create session
7. On failure: Increment failed MFA attempts (max 5 before temporary lock)
```

### 8.2 Backup Codes

When MFA is enabled, 8 single-use backup codes are generated.

```
Format:    XXXXX-XXXXX (10 alphanumeric characters, dash in middle)
Example:   A3K9M-7BZ2Q
Quantity:  8 codes
Storage:   Each code hashed with bcrypt (cost 10) before storage in MfaBackupCode table
Usage:     Each code can be used exactly once
After use: Code is marked used (isUsed: true, usedAt: timestamp) — never deleted
Viewing:   Shown ONCE at MFA setup. Never retrievable afterward.
           User must disable and re-enable MFA to get new backup codes.
```

**Backup code login flow:**

```
1. At MFA challenge step, user clicks "Use backup code"
2. POST /auth/mfa/verify { challengeToken, backupCode: "A3K9M-7BZ2Q" }
3. API fetches all non-used backup codes for the user
4. API bcrypt.compare(input, each stored hash) until match found
5. On match: Mark code as used, issue tokens, create session
6. API sends alert notification: "A backup code was used to log in from [IP]"
7. If user has fewer than 3 backup codes remaining, recommend generating new ones
```

### 8.3 MFA Enforcement Policy

| Role | MFA Status |
|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | **Mandatory** — account cannot be used without MFA |
| `GOVERNMENT_ADMIN` | **Mandatory** |
| `MINISTRY_ADMIN` | **Mandatory** |
| `DEPARTMENT_ADMIN` | **Strongly recommended** — enforced by system configuration |
| `DIVISION_ADMIN` | Optional (default) |
| `TEAM_MANAGER` | Optional (default) |
| `EMPLOYEE` | Optional (default) |
| `GUEST` | Optional (default) |

Enforcement is configured via the `SystemConfig` model. When enforcement is active, users with that role are redirected to MFA setup on first login after the policy is activated. They cannot use the platform until MFA is configured.

### 8.4 Future: FIDO2 / WebAuthn (v1.0+)

Hardware security keys (YubiKey 5) and platform authenticators (Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID) will be supported via the WebAuthn API for the highest-risk accounts.

```
Registration:   navigator.credentials.create(publicKeyCredentialCreationOptions)
Authentication: navigator.credentials.get(publicKeyCredentialRequestOptions)
Storage:        MfaDevice model stores { credentialId, publicKey, counter, deviceName }
```

FIDO2 will be available as an alternative to TOTP, not a replacement. Users may register multiple FIDO2 devices (e.g., a YubiKey and a backup device).

## 9. Password Policy

### 9.1 Requirements

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Minimum length | 12 characters |
| Maximum length | 128 characters (prevents DoS via bcrypt on very long passwords) |
| Uppercase required | At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z) |
| Lowercase required | At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z) |
| Number required | At least 1 digit (0-9) |
| Special character required | At least 1 special character (`!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:',.<>?`) |
| Common password rejection | Checked against a list of 100,000 most common passwords |
| Breach check | Optional: k-anonymity check via HaveIBeenPwned API (first 5 chars of SHA-1 hash only) |
| History | Cannot reuse the last 10 passwords (hashes stored in `PasswordHistory` table) |
| Hashing algorithm | bcrypt with cost factor 12 |
| Expiry — privileged roles | 90 days (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `GOVERNMENT_ADMIN`, `MINISTRY_ADMIN`) |
| Expiry — standard roles | 180 days |
| Expiry enforcement | User is redirected to password change screen. Cannot access platform until changed. |

### 9.2 Password Reset Flow

```
1. User submits: POST /auth/forgot-password { credential: "1.641.558" }
   (credential is matricule OR email)

2. API looks up user by credential (case-insensitive for email)

3. Regardless of whether user is found, API returns HTTP 200:
   { message: "If an account with that credential exists, a reset email has been sent." }
   (Prevents user enumeration attacks)

4. If user IS found AND has a government email:
   a. Generate 32 bytes of cryptographically random data (crypto.randomBytes(32))
   b. Convert to hex string (64 chars) → this is the raw token sent in the email
   c. SHA-256 hash the raw token → this is what is stored in the DB
   d. Create PasswordResetToken record:
      { userId, tokenHash, expiresAt: now() + 1 hour, used: false }
   e. Send email with link: https://govsphere.gouv.cd/reset-password?token={rawToken}

5. User clicks link → client sends: POST /auth/reset-password { token, newPassword }

6. API:
   a. SHA-256 hashes the received token
   b. Finds PasswordResetToken where tokenHash matches AND used = false AND expiresAt > now()
   c. If not found: return HTTP 400 { error: "TOKEN_INVALID_OR_EXPIRED" }
   d. Validates new password against policy
   e. Checks password history (cannot reuse last 10)
   f. Hashes new password with bcrypt
   g. Updates User.passwordHash
   h. Marks PasswordResetToken.used = true
   i. Invalidates all active sessions for this user (force re-login on all devices)
   j. Blacklists all active access tokens for this user in Redis
   k. Writes AUDIT LOG: PASSWORD_RESET

7. Returns HTTP 200 { message: "Password reset successful. Please log in." }
```

### 9.3 Account Lockout

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| 5 consecutive failed login attempts | Account `status` set to `LOCKED`. `lockedUntil` set to `now() + 30 minutes`. |
| 10 consecutive failed login attempts | Account `status` set to `LOCKED`. `lockedUntil` set to null (manual admin unlock required). |
| Successful login | `failedLoginCount` reset to 0. |
| Admin unlock | `status` set to `ACTIVE`, `lockedUntil` cleared, `failedLoginCount` reset to 0. |
| Lockout expiry | On next login attempt, API checks `lockedUntil < now()` — if passed, unlocks automatically. |

**Response on locked account:** HTTP 401 with `{ error: "ACCOUNT_LOCKED", lockedUntil: ISO_TIMESTAMP }`. The lockout duration is disclosed (not the reason for lockout) to allow legitimate users to know when to try again.

## 10. Audit Logging

### 10.1 Audit Log Record Structure

Every audit log entry has:

```typescript
{
  id:           string    // CUID
  userId:       string    // Who performed the action (null for system events)
  action:       string    // Event type (enum)
  entityType:   string    // What was affected (e.g., "USER", "CHANNEL", "FILE")
  entityId:     string    // ID of the affected entity
  metadata:     JSON      // Event-specific context (see per-event schema below)
  ipAddress:    string    // Request IP (from X-Forwarded-For via NGINX)
  userAgent:    string    // Browser/client identifier
  createdAt:    DateTime  // Immutable timestamp
}
```

**Immutability guarantee:** The database user has only `INSERT` and `SELECT` on `audit_logs`. `UPDATE` and `DELETE` are never granted to the application user.

## 11. Database Review & Schema Proposals

### 11.1 Review of Current Schema (v1 Migration)

The current Prisma schema (`packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`) contains 13 models covering the core communication features. The `User` model has foundational identity fields. However, the identity platform requires additional models and fields that are not yet present.

**What the current schema has (correct):**
- `User` model with `matricule`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `role` (enum), `status` (enum), `mfaEnabled`, `mfaSecret`, `failedLoginCount`, `lockedUntil`
- `UserRole` enum with all 8 roles
- `UserStatus` enum with `ACTIVE`, `PENDING`, `SUSPENDED`, `DEACTIVATED`, `LOCKED`
- Basic `AuditLog` model

**What is missing and must be added:**

### 11.2 Proposed New Models

#### Model: `Role` (Custom role definitions)

The current schema uses a `UserRole` enum which is suitable for standard roles. However, to support custom ministry-specific roles in the future, a `Role` table is needed.

```prisma
model Role {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String   @unique               // e.g., "MINISTRY_ADMIN"
  displayName String                          // e.g., "Ministry Administrator"
  weight      Int                             // 0–100
  isSystem    Boolean  @default(false)        // true = cannot be deleted
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  permissions RolePermission[]
  userRoles   UserRole[]

  @@map("roles")
}
```

#### Model: `Permission` (Fine-grained capabilities)

```prisma
model Permission {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  key         String   @unique               // e.g., "USER:CREATE"
  description String
  resource    String                          // e.g., "USER"
  action      String                          // e.g., "CREATE"
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  rolePermissions RolePermission[]

  @@map("permissions")
}
```

#### Model: `RolePermission` (Join: Role → Permissions)

```prisma
model RolePermission {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  roleId       String
  permissionId String
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())

  role       Role       @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])
  permission Permission @relation(fields: [permissionId], references: [id])

  @@unique([roleId, permissionId])
  @@map("role_permissions")
}
```

#### Model: `UserRole` (Join: User → Role, with scope)

The current schema has `role UserRole` as a simple enum on the `User` model. This must be replaced with a join table to support scoped roles and multiple roles per user.

```prisma
model UserRole {
  id           String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String
  roleId       String
  ministryId   String?   // scope: null = system-wide
  departmentId String?   // scope: null = ministry-wide
  divisionId   String?   // scope: null = department-wide
  grantedBy    String    // adminUserId who assigned this role
  grantedAt    DateTime  @default(now())
  expiresAt    DateTime?  // optional: role expires on a date

  user       User       @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  role       Role       @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id])

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([roleId])
  @@map("user_roles")
}
```

#### Model: `UserSession` (Active login sessions)

```prisma
model UserSession {
  id           String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId       String
  deviceId     String?   // links to UserDevice
  ipAddress    String
  userAgent    String
  platform     String    // "web" | "desktop" | "mobile"
  refreshToken String?   // hashed refresh token jti (for validation)
  isActive     Boolean   @default(true)
  lastUsedAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  revokedAt    DateTime?
  expiresAt    DateTime  // session hard expiry (30 days from creation)
  createdAt    DateTime  @default(now())

  device UserDevice? @relation(fields: [deviceId], references: [id])

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([refreshToken])
  @@map("user_sessions")
}
```

#### Model: `UserDevice` (Registered devices)

```prisma
model UserDevice {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  userId      String
  name        String    // "Chrome on macOS", "GovSphere Android"
  platform    String    // "web" | "desktop" | "mobile"

  user     User          @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  sessions UserSession[]

  @@index([userId])
  @@unique([userId, fingerprint])
  @@map("user_devices")
}
```

#### Model: `LoginHistory` (All login attempts, success and failure)

```prisma
model LoginHistory {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String?  // null if user not found (failed attempt for unknown credential)
  credential String   // the matricule or email that was used (for lookup)
  success    Boolean
  failReason String?  // "INVALID_PASSWORD" | "ACCOUNT_LOCKED" | "USER_NOT_FOUND" etc.

  user User? @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([ipAddress])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@map("login_history")
}
```

#### Model: `PasswordResetToken`

```prisma
model PasswordResetToken {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId    String
  tokenHash String   @unique   // SHA-256 hash of the raw token
  used      Boolean  @default(false)

```

#### Model: `MfaDevice` (Future: FIDO2/WebAuthn devices)

```prisma

  userId       String

}
```

### 11.3 Required Changes to Existing `User` Model

The `User` model needs these additions:

```prisma
// ADD to User model:
userType       UserType   @default(EMPLOYEE)    // see UserType enum below
displayName    String?                            // preferred display name (may differ from full name)
firstName      String
lastName       String
lockedUntil    DateTime?                          // auto-unlock after this timestamp
passwordChangedAt DateTime?                       // for expiry enforcement
lastLoginAt    DateTime?                          // for inactive account detection

// REMOVE from User model:
role           UserRole                           // replaced by UserRole join table
// (keep the enum definition for backward compat, but deprecate the field)
```

### 11.4 New Enums Required

```prisma
enum UserType {
  GOVERNMENT_EMPLOYEE
  MINISTER
  DIRECTOR
  DEPARTMENT_ADMIN
  IT_ADMINISTRATOR
  EXTERNAL_PARTNER
  GUEST
}

enum UserStatus {
  PENDING
  ACTIVE
  SUSPENDED
  LOCKED
  DEACTIVATED
  ARCHIVED
}
```

`UserStatus` already exists in the current schema — verify it has `LOCKED` and `ARCHIVED`.

---

## 12. API Design

All endpoints use the base path `/v1`. All requests require `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}` except the public auth endpoints marked `[PUBLIC]`.

## 13. Security Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Stolen Access Token

**Threat:** An attacker intercepts or extracts a valid access token and uses it to impersonate the user.

**Mitigations:**
- Access token TTL is 15 minutes — short enough to limit damage
- Token is stored in memory only — cannot be extracted by XSS
- JTI (token ID) in Redis blacklist enables immediate revocation
- Anomaly detection: if a token is used from a different IP than the one that created the session, flag for review

### Risk 2: Stolen Refresh Token

**Threat:** An attacker extracts the refresh token from the cookie and uses it to generate unlimited access tokens.

**Mitigations:**
- HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Strict cookie prevents XSS and CSRF access
- Token family tracking: reuse of an already-rotated token triggers immediate session termination
- Refresh tokens can be revoked via "Logout all devices"
- Refresh cookie path is `/auth/refresh` only — not sent on every request

### Risk 3: Weak Passwords

**Threat:** Users choose easily guessable passwords. An attacker guesses or brute-forces them.

**Mitigations:**
- 12-character minimum with complexity requirements
- Common password blocklist (100,000 entries)
- HaveIBeenPwned breach check
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Mandatory expiry for privileged roles (90 days)
- bcrypt cost 12 — makes offline brute force computationally expensive

### Risk 4: Shared Accounts

**Threat:** Two civil servants share one account, destroying accountability and audit trail integrity.

**Mitigations:**
- Matricule is unique per civil servant by government assignment — the system enforces uniqueness
- Audit logs capture IP, user agent, and session ID per action — anomalous concurrent access is detectable
- Device tracking flags when an account is used from a new, unrecognized device
- Account sharing is a disciplinary matter covered in the platform's Terms of Use
- MFA enforcement for privileged roles — sharing the account means sharing the TOTP device, which is impractical

### Risk 5: Privilege Escalation

**Threat:** A user assigns themselves or another user a higher role than authorized. Or exploits a bug to bypass scope restrictions.

**Mitigations:**
- `USER:UPDATE_ROLE` permission is required to assign roles
- Scope restriction: a MINISTRY_ADMIN can only assign roles up to `DEPARTMENT_ADMIN` within their ministry (cannot create MINISTRY_ADMIN or higher)
- All role assignments are audit-logged with the granting admin's ID
- RBAC checks are enforced at the API service layer — not only the controller
- Unit tests cover all RBAC boundary conditions

### Risk 6: Unauthorized File Access

**Threat:** A user constructs a direct URL to a file in MinIO and downloads it without authorization.

**Mitigations:**
- MinIO files are not publicly accessible — bucket policies deny all public read
- Every download requires a pre-signed URL generated by the API
- The API verifies the requesting user's channel membership before generating the URL
- Pre-signed URLs expire in 5 minutes
- Every download is audit-logged

### Risk 7: Brute Force Attacks

**Threat:** An automated attacker submits thousands of login attempts against a user's account.

**Mitigations:**
- Account lockout after 5 failures
- IP-level rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP on all `/auth/*` endpoints)
- Global rate limiting on the login endpoint (BullMQ rate limiter)
- CAPTCHA integration (optional) for accounts with repeated lockout history

### Risk 8: Insider Threat

**Threat:** A civil servant with legitimate access misuses it — exfiltrates data, reads unauthorized channels, covers tracks.

**Mitigations:**
- Audit logs are immutable — the application user cannot DELETE or UPDATE audit records
- Audit log access requires `ADMIN:VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS_MINISTRY` or higher
- Audit logs exported to WORM storage for long-term retention
- Anomaly detection (future): alert on unusual access patterns (off-hours, bulk file downloads)
- Least privilege: employees only have access to channels they are explicitly added to
- All file downloads are logged with user identity and timestamp

### Risk 9: Session Fixation

**Threat:** An attacker sets a known session token before login, then after the user logs in, uses the pre-set token.

**Mitigation:**
- A new session ID is always generated on successful login
- There is no mechanism to pre-set or predict session IDs (CUIDs are cryptographically random)

### Risk 10: JWT Algorithm Confusion

**Threat:** An attacker sends a JWT with `alg: "none"` or switches from RS256 to HS256.

**Mitigation:**
- The API uses `jsonwebtoken` with `algorithms: ["RS256"]` explicitly specified
- Any token with a different algorithm is rejected at validation time

## 14. Implementation Plan

The Identity Platform is implemented in the following sequence. Each task must be completed and reviewed before the next begins.

### Task 1: Prisma Schema Update

**Goal:** Add all new identity models to the schema and create the migration.

**Scope:**
- Add `Role`, `Permission`, `RolePermission` models
- Add `UserRole` join table (replace enum field on User)
- Add `UserSession`, `UserDevice`, `LoginHistory` models
- Add `PasswordResetToken`, `PasswordHistory` models
- Add `MfaDevice`, `MfaBackupCode` models
- Add `userType`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `displayName`, `lockedUntil`, `passwordChangedAt`, `lastLoginAt` to User
- Add `UserType` enum
- Verify `UserStatus` has all 6 statuses
- Run `prisma migrate dev --name add_identity_platform`
- Seed default roles and permissions

**Output:** Updated schema file, migration file, seed data script.

### Task 2: Auth Module (NestJS)

**Goal:** Implement the authentication service and routes.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.module.ts`
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts` — login, refresh, logout, token generation
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.controller.ts` — POST /auth/login, /auth/refresh, /auth/logout, /auth/logout-all
- `apps/api/src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts` — validates access tokens
- `apps/api/src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`
- `apps/api/src/auth/guards/roles.guard.ts`
- `apps/api/src/auth/decorators/current-user.decorator.ts`
- `apps/api/src/auth/decorators/public.decorator.ts`
- Unit tests: auth.service.spec.ts

**Output:** Working login flow returning JWT access token + refresh token cookie.

### Task 3: User Module (NestJS)

**Goal:** User CRUD for administrators.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/users/users.module.ts`
- `apps/api/src/users/users.service.ts` — findById, create, updateStatus, list with pagination and filters
- `apps/api/src/users/users.controller.ts` — GET /users, POST /users, PATCH /users/:id/status, GET /auth/me
- DTOs: `create-user.dto.ts`, `update-user-status.dto.ts`
- Response transformers: strip passwordHash, mfaSecret from all responses
- Unit tests: users.service.spec.ts

**Output:** Admin can create and manage users via API.

### Task 4: Role Module (NestJS)

**Goal:** Manage roles and assign them to users with scope.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/roles/roles.module.ts`
- `apps/api/src/roles/roles.service.ts` — findAll, create, assignToUser, revokeFromUser
- `apps/api/src/roles/roles.controller.ts` — GET /roles, POST /roles, POST /users/:id/roles
- Seeder: insert the 8 default system roles with their permission sets
- Unit tests

**Output:** RBAC role assignment works end-to-end.

### Task 5: Permission Module (NestJS)

**Goal:** Register permissions and attach them to roles.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/permissions/permissions.module.ts`
- `apps/api/src/permissions/permissions.service.ts` — resolvePermissionsForUser(userId)
- Permission seeder: insert all permissions defined in Section 5.3
- `resolvePermissionsForUser` called on every authenticated request to populate the request context
- Unit tests: all RBAC boundary conditions tested

**Output:** Permissions are enforced. Every API route checks the correct permission.

### Task 6: Session Module (NestJS)

**Goal:** Device-aware session tracking and revocation.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/sessions/sessions.module.ts`
- `apps/api/src/sessions/sessions.service.ts` — create, list, revoke, revokeAll, cleanup
- `apps/api/src/sessions/sessions.controller.ts` — GET /sessions, DELETE /sessions/:id, DELETE /sessions (all)
- Redis integration for token blacklisting
- Scheduled job: invalidate sessions with `lastUsedAt > 30 days`
- Unit tests

**Output:** Users can see and revoke their active sessions.

### Task 7: MFA Scaffolding

**Goal:** TOTP MFA with backup codes.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/auth/mfa/mfa.service.ts` — generateSecret, verifySetup, verifyCode, generateBackupCodes, verifyBackupCode
- `apps/api/src/auth/mfa/mfa.controller.ts` — POST /auth/mfa/setup, /auth/mfa/verify-setup, /auth/mfa/verify
- MFA enforcement guard: checks mfaEnabled for roles that require it
- MFA challenge token logic (short-lived JWT, 5-minute TTL)
- Encryption of TOTP secret with AES-256-GCM
- Unit tests: mfa.service.spec.ts

**Output:** Users can enable TOTP MFA and use it during login.

### Task 8: Audit Logging

**Goal:** Immutable, comprehensive audit trail for all identity events.

**Scope:**
- `apps/api/src/audit/audit.service.ts` — log(event) method, async BullMQ queue
- BullMQ queue: audit-log-queue (write to DB asynchronously to avoid blocking request)
- `apps/api/src/audit/audit.controller.ts` — GET /audit-logs (with filters, pagination)
- Interceptor: auto-log all mutating requests
- Unit tests: verify each audit event is logged with correct metadata

**Output:** All identity events produce immutable audit log entries.

### Task 9: Frontend Login Pages (Next.js)

**Goal:** Login, MFA verification, password reset, and first-login password change screens.

**Scope:**
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — Matricule or email + password form
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/mfa/page.tsx` — TOTP code input + backup code option
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx` — Credential input
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx` — New password form
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/change-password/page.tsx` — Forced password change (first login)
- `useAuth` hook: wraps API calls, manages access token in memory
- Auth middleware: redirects unauthenticated requests to /login

**Output:** A working, styled login flow in the web app.

### Task 10: Admin User Management UI (Next.js)

**Goal:** Admin panel screens for managing users, roles, and viewing audit logs.

**Scope:**
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/page.tsx` — Paginated user list with filters
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/[id]/page.tsx` — User detail: status, roles, sessions, audit history
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users/new/page.tsx` — Create user form
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/audit/page.tsx` — Audit log viewer with date range + event type filters
- Role-based route protection: redirect non-admins away from /admin/*

**Output:** Administrators can manage the full user lifecycle from the web interface.

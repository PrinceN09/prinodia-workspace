## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Security issues in GovSphere may expose sensitive government data or authentication systems. We take all reports seriously and will respond promptly.

### Responsible Disclosure

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing **security@govsphere.gouv.cd**.

Include in your report:
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., authentication bypass, privilege escalation, SQL injection)
- Affected component (e.g., API auth, RBAC, file storage)
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact and affected data
- Your suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Within 48 hours | Acknowledgement of your report |
| Within 7 days | Initial assessment and severity classification |
| Within 30 days | Fix deployed or mitigation applied |
| After fix | Coordinated public disclosure (if appropriate) |

We follow [responsible disclosure](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html) practices. We will not take legal action against researchers who report vulnerabilities in good faith.

## Security Architecture

For the full security architecture, see [docs/07_Security_Architecture.md](./docs/07_Security_Architecture.md).

Key security properties:
- Zero Trust architecture — every request authenticated and authorized
- RS256 asymmetric JWT — private key never leaves the API server
- AES-256-GCM for TOTP secrets at rest
- bcrypt cost 12 for password hashing
- Immutable audit logs (DB user has INSERT + SELECT only)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
